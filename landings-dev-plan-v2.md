# PHASE 0: DISCOVERY QUESTIONNAIRE

## 🗣️ Conversational Q&A Flow

> **INSTRUCTION FOR AI IN GOOGLE ANTIGRAVITY:** This is a **universal landing page builder** that works for ANY product or service. Ask questions, gather information about the user's specific business/product, then generate ALL content dynamically based on their answers.

---

## 📋 HOW THIS WORKS

### For the AI:
1. **Greet** the user and explain this works for any product/service
2. **Ask Section A first** — this gathers core business/product information
3. **Generate content** for all sections based on Section A answers
4. **Ask remaining sections** (B-L) for design/technical preferences
5. **Confirm** everything before building
6. **Create all text content** dynamically (hero, features, testimonials, FAQ, etc.)

### For the User:
- Answer naturally in chat
- Say **"skip"** or **"default"** to use AI-suggested values
- Say **"back"** to change a previous answer
- Say **"show answers"** to see current configuration
- Say **"start building"** to skip remaining questions

# ANIMATION SYSTEM

## 🎬 Overview

Based on the Protex Webflow template reference, implement these animation patterns:

### Animation Types

| Type | Usage | Duration | Easing |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| Slide-In | Block elements on first load | 600ms | cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94) |
| Blur-Fade | Text and badges | 500ms | ease-out |
| Infinite Marquee | Logos, Testimonials | 30s-40s | linear |
| Hover Glow | Cards, buttons | 200ms | ease |

---

## 1. BLOCK ELEMENT SLIDE-IN ANIMATION

> Elements slide up 4-5px (or 2rem for larger effect) with blur fade on first load

### CSS Implementation

```css
/* globals.css */

/* Animation Keyframes */
@keyframes slideInUp {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    filter: blur(10px);
    transform: translate3d(0, 2rem, 0);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    filter: blur(0);
    transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);
  }
}

@keyframes slideInUpSmall {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    filter: blur(5px);
    transform: translate3d(0, 5px, 0);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    filter: blur(0);
    transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);
  }
}

/* Base animation class */
.animate-slide-in {
  opacity: 0;
  filter: blur(10px);
  transform: translate3d(0, 2rem, 0);
}

.animate-slide-in.in-view {
  animation: slideInUp 0.6s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94) forwards;
}

/* Small slide (4-5px) for subtle elements */
.animate-slide-in-small {
  opacity: 0;
  filter: blur(5px);
  transform: translate3d(0, 5px, 0);
}

.animate-slide-in-small.in-view {
  animation: slideInUpSmall 0.5s ease-out forwards;
}

/* Stagger delays */
.stagger-1 { animation-delay: 0.1s; }
.stagger-2 { animation-delay: 0.2s; }
.stagger-3 { animation-delay: 0.3s; }
.stagger-4 { animation-delay: 0.4s; }
.stagger-5 { animation-delay: 0.5s; }
.stagger-6 { animation-delay: 0.6s; }
```

### React Hook Implementation

```typescript
// hooks/useScrollAnimation.ts
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

interface UseScrollAnimationOptions {
  threshold?: number;
  rootMargin?: string;
  triggerOnce?: boolean;
}

export function useScrollAnimation(options: UseScrollAnimationOptions = {}) {
  const {
    threshold = 0.1,
    rootMargin = '0px 0px -50px 0px',
    triggerOnce = true
  } = options;

  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const [isInView, setIsInView] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const element = ref.current;
    if (!element) return;

    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      ([entry]) => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
          setIsInView(true);
          if (triggerOnce) {
            observer.unobserve(element);
          }
        } else if (!triggerOnce) {
          setIsInView(false);
        }
      },
      { threshold, rootMargin }
    );

    observer.observe(element);
    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, [threshold, rootMargin, triggerOnce]);

  return { ref, isInView };
}
```

### AnimatedBlock Component

```tsx
// components/ui/AnimatedBlock.tsx
'use client';

import { useScrollAnimation } from '@/hooks/useScrollAnimation';
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';

interface AnimatedBlockProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
  delay?: number;
  variant?: 'default' | 'small';
}

export function AnimatedBlock({
  children,
  className,
  delay = 0,
  variant = 'default'
}: AnimatedBlockProps) {
  const { ref, isInView } = useScrollAnimation();

  return (
    <div
      ref={ref}
      className={cn(
        variant === 'default' ? 'animate-slide-in' : 'animate-slide-in-small',
        isInView && 'in-view',
        className
      )}
      style={{ animationDelay: `${delay}s` }}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Framer Motion Alternative

```tsx
// components/ui/AnimatedBlock.tsx (Framer Motion version)
'use client';

import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
import { useInView } from 'framer-motion';
import { useRef } from 'react';

interface AnimatedBlockProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
  delay?: number;
  distance?: number; // 5 for small, 32 for large
}

const slideInVariants = {
  hidden: (distance: number) => ({
    opacity: 0,
    filter: 'blur(10px)',
    y: distance,
  }),
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    filter: 'blur(0px)',
    y: 0,
  },
};

export function AnimatedBlock({
  children,
  className,
  delay = 0,
  distance = 32, // 2rem = 32px default
}: AnimatedBlockProps) {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  const isInView = useInView(ref, { once: true, margin: '-50px' });

  return (
    <motion.div
      ref={ref}
      className={className}
      custom={distance}
      initial="hidden"
      animate={isInView ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}
      variants={slideInVariants}
      transition={{
        duration: 0.6,
        delay,
        ease: [0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94],
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

  100% {
    transform: translateX(-50%);
  }
}

@keyframes marquee-reverse {
  0% {

      if (containerRef.current) {
        const containerWidth = containerRef.current.offsetWidth;
        const contentWidth = containerRef.current.scrollWidth / duplicateCount;
        const needed = Math.ceil((containerWidth * 2) / contentWidth) + 1;
        setDuplicateCount(Math.max(2, needed));
      }
    };

    calculateDuplicates();
    window.addEventListener('resize', calculateDuplicates);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', calculateDuplicates);

# SECTION SPECIFICATIONS

## SECTION 2: HERO SCROLL ANIMATION

> ⚠️ **LOCKED SECTION** — Do not modify the technical implementation. Only TEXT CONTENT is dynamic.

**File:** `components/sections/02-HeroScrollAnimation.tsx`
**Section ID:** None (hero)

### Purpose
The centerpiece. A sticky canvas that reveals the emblem's craftsmanship through scroll-driven animation. As users scroll, the emblem "builds" or "reveals layers" — showing the doming process, adhesive backing, and premium finish.

---

### 1. CONTAINER

```tsx
// Container wrapping the entire hero section
<section 
  ref={containerRef}
  className="relative h-[500vh] bg-[#050505]"
>
  {/* 500vh = 5x viewport height for extended scroll duration */}
  {/* Background MUST match frame images exactly: #050505 */}
</section>
```

**Specifications:**
- Height: `500vh` (5× viewport for long scroll duration)
- Background: `#050505` (MUST match frame image background exactly)
- Position: `relative` (for sticky child positioning)

---

### 2. STICKY CANVAS

```tsx
// Sticky canvas that stays in viewport while scrolling
<div className="sticky top-0 h-screen w-full flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden">
  <canvas
    ref={canvasRef}
    className="max-w-full max-h-full object-contain"
    style={{
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%',
    }}
  />
</div>
```

**Specifications:**
- Position: `sticky`, `top-0`
- Size: `h-screen`, `w-full` (100vh × 100vw)
- Canvas sizing: `object-contain`, centered
- Handle window resize for proper canvas dimensions

**Resize Handler:**
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleResize = () => {
    const canvas = canvasRef.current;
    if (canvas) {
      // Set canvas size to window dimensions
      canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
      canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
      // Redraw current frame after resize
      if (images[currentFrameIndex]) {
        drawFrame(currentFrameIndex);
      }
    }
  };

  handleResize();
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
}, [currentFrameIndex, images]);
```

---

### 3. IMAGE SEQUENCE LOADER

**Hook:** `hooks/useImageSequence.ts`

```typescript
interface UseImageSequenceOptions {
  frameCount: number;        // From questionnaire C1 (default: 70)
  basePath: string;          // "/scroll-frames"
  filePattern: string;       // From questionnaire C2 (default: "frame_{n}.webp")
  paddingDigits: number;     // 3 for "001", 2 for "01", 0 for "1"
}

export function useImageSequence({
  frameCount,
  basePath,
  filePattern,
  paddingDigits = 3,
}: UseImageSequenceOptions) {
  const [images, setImages] = useState<HTMLImageElement[]>([]);
  const [isLoaded, setIsLoaded] = useState(false);
  const [loadProgress, setLoadProgress] = useState(0);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let isMounted = true;
    const loadedImages: HTMLImageElement[] = [];
    let loadedCount = 0;

    const loadImages = async () => {
      const imagePromises = Array.from({ length: frameCount }, (_, i) => {
        return new Promise<HTMLImageElement>((resolve, reject) => {
          const img = new Image();
          
          // Generate filename based on pattern
          const frameNumber = paddingDigits > 0
            ? String(i + 1).padStart(paddingDigits, '0')
            : String(i + 1);
          
          img.src = `${basePath}/frame_${frameNumber}.webp`;
          
          img.onload = () => {
            loadedCount++;
            if (isMounted) {
              setLoadProgress(loadedCount / frameCount);
            }
            loadedImages[i] = img;
            resolve(img);
          };
          
          img.onerror = () => {
            reject(new Error(`Failed to load frame ${i + 1}`));
          };
        });
      });

      try {
        await Promise.all(imagePromises);
        if (isMounted) {
          setImages(loadedImages);
          setIsLoaded(true);
        }
      } catch (err) {
        if (isMounted) {
          setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Failed to load images');
        }
      }
    };

    loadImages();

    return () => {
      isMounted = false;
    };
  }, [frameCount, basePath, paddingDigits]);

  return { images, isLoaded, loadProgress, error };
}
```

**Loading Indicator:**
```tsx
{!isLoaded && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-[#050505] z-50 flex items-center justify-center">
    <div className="text-center">
      {/* Circular Progress */}
      <div className="relative w-24 h-24 mx-auto mb-6">
        <svg className="w-full h-full -rotate-90">

            fill="none"
          />
          {/* Progress circle */}
          <circle
            cx="48" cy="48" r="44"
            stroke="#C9A227"
            strokeWidth="4"
            fill="none"
            strokeDasharray={276}
            strokeDashoffset={276 - (276 * loadProgress)}
            strokeLinecap="round"
            className="transition-all duration-100"
          />
        </svg>
        {/* Percentage text */}
        <span className="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center text-white/60 text-sm font-mono">
          {Math.round(loadProgress * 100)}%
        </span>
      </div>
      <p className="text-white/40 text-sm tracking-widest uppercase">
        Loading Experience
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### 4. SCROLL LOGIC

```tsx
import { useScroll, useMotionValueEvent } from 'framer-motion';

// Inside component
const containerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
const canvasRef = useRef<HTMLCanvasElement>(null);
const [currentFrameIndex, setCurrentFrameIndex] = useState(0);

// Frame count from questionnaire (C1)
const FRAME_COUNT = 70; // Dynamic from config

// Setup scroll tracking
const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({
  target: containerRef,
  offset: ["start start", "end end"]
});

// Draw frame function
const drawFrame = useCallback((frameIndex: number) => {
  const canvas = canvasRef.current;
  const ctx = canvas?.getContext('2d');
  const img = images[frameIndex];

  if (ctx && img && canvas) {
    // Clear canvas
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

    // Calculate contain-fit positioning
    const canvasAspect = canvas.width / canvas.height;
    const imgAspect = img.width / img.height;

    let drawWidth, drawHeight, drawX, drawY;

    if (imgAspect > canvasAspect) {
      // Image is wider than canvas
      drawWidth = canvas.width;
      drawHeight = canvas.width / imgAspect;
      drawX = 0;
      drawY = (canvas.height - drawHeight) / 2;
    } else {
      // Image is taller than canvas
      drawHeight = canvas.height;
      drawWidth = canvas.height * imgAspect;
      drawX = (canvas.width - drawWidth) / 2;
      drawY = 0;
    }

    ctx.drawImage(img, drawX, drawY, drawWidth, drawHeight);
  }
}, [images]);

// Listen to scroll and update frame
useMotionValueEvent(scrollYProgress, "change", (progress) => {
  if (!isLoaded) return;

  const frameIndex = Math.min(
    Math.floor(progress * FRAME_COUNT),
    FRAME_COUNT - 1
  );

  if (frameIndex !== currentFrameIndex) {
    setCurrentFrameIndex(frameIndex);
    drawFrame(frameIndex);
  }
});

// Initial draw when loaded
useEffect(() => {
  if (isLoaded && images.length > 0) {
    drawFrame(0);
  }
}, [isLoaded, images, drawFrame]);
```

### 5. TEXT OVERLAYS

```tsx
import { motion, useTransform } from 'framer-motion';

// Text section configuration
interface TextSection {
  id: string;
  startProgress: number;  // 0-1 when to start fading in
  endProgress: number;    // 0-1 when to finish fading out
  position: 'center' | 'left' | 'right';
  content: React.ReactNode;
}

// Text overlay component
function TextOverlay({
  section,
  scrollYProgress,
}: {
  section: TextSection;
  scrollYProgress: MotionValue<number>;
}) {
  // Calculate opacity based on scroll progress
  // Fade in from start to start+5%, stay visible, fade out from end-5% to end
  const opacity = useTransform(
    scrollYProgress,
    [
      section.startProgress,
      section.startProgress + 0.03,
      section.endProgress - 0.03,
      section.endProgress,
    ],
    [0, 1, 1, 0]
  );

  // Position classes based on alignment
  const positionClasses = {
    center: 'items-center justify-center text-center',
    left: 'items-center justify-start text-left pl-8 md:pl-16 lg:pl-24',
    right: 'items-center justify-end text-right pr-8 md:pr-16 lg:pr-24',
  };

  return (
    <motion.div
      className={`absolute inset-0 flex ${positionClasses[section.position]} pointer-events-none`}
      style={{ opacity }}
    >
      <div className="max-w-xl pointer-events-auto">
        {section.content}
      </div>
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

**Typography Styles:**
```tsx
// Headline style (Bebas Neue)
<h2 className="font-display text-4xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl text-white tracking-wide">
  {headline}
</h2>

// Body text style (Plus Jakarta Sans)
<p className="font-body text-base md:text-lg text-white/70 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
  {description}
</p>

// CTA Button style
<a 
  href="https://www.hubcapstickers.com"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  className="inline-flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-gold text-black font-semibold rounded-full hover:brightness-110 transition-all mt-8"
>
  {buttonText}
</a>
```

### 7. MOBILE OPTIMIZATION

```tsx
// Mobile-specific adjustments
const isMobile = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.innerWidth < 768;

// Reduced frame count for mobile (optional)
const MOBILE_FRAME_COUNT = 70;
const DESKTOP_FRAME_COUNT = 70;
const frameCount = isMobile ? MOBILE_FRAME_COUNT : DESKTOP_FRAME_COUNT;

// Mobile text size classes
const headlineSizes = {
  hero: 'text-4xl md:text-7xl lg:text-9xl',
  feature: 'text-2xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl',
  cta: 'text-3xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl',
};

// Mobile padding
const mobilePadding = 'px-6 md:px-8 lg:px-16 xl:px-24';
```

**Mobile Performance Tips:**
```typescript
// 1. Use lower resolution frames for mobile
// /scroll-frames/mobile/ folder with 960×540 frames
// /scroll-frames/desktop/ folder with 1920×1080 frames

const basePath = isMobile ? '/scroll-frames/mobile' : '/scroll-frames/desktop';

// 2. Reduce frame count on mobile
// Instead of 140 frames, use every 2nd frame (70 total)

// 3. Use will-change for better performance
<canvas 
  ref={canvasRef}
  style={{ willChange: 'contents' }}
/>

// 4. Debounce resize handler
const debouncedResize = useMemo(
  () => debounce(handleResize, 100),
  [handleResize]
);
```

### Avatar AI Generation Task

```
When building this section, generate 5 avatar images using AI:

1. Generate with prompt: "Professional headshot photo of [description], 
   neutral background, warm lighting, slight smile"

2. Save to: /public/avatars/[name].webp

3. Descriptions:
   - michael.webp: 35yo Caucasian man, short brown hair
   - sarah.webp: 30yo woman, blonde hair, blue eyes
   - thomas.webp: 45yo man, gray hair, beard, glasses
   - david.webp: 40yo man, tan skin, dark hair
   - james.webp: 28yo man, short black hair

4. Fallback: UI Avatars API if generation fails
```

# APPENDIX

## A. Animation CSS Variables

```css
/* tailwind.config.js */
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      animation: {
        'slide-in': 'slideInUp 0.6s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94) forwards',
        'slide-in-small': 'slideInUpSmall 0.5s ease-out forwards',
        'marquee': 'marquee 40s linear infinite',
        'marquee-reverse': 'marquee-reverse 40s linear infinite',
        'pulse-gold': 'pulseGold 2s infinite',
      },
      keyframes: {
        slideInUp: {
          from: { opacity: '0', filter: 'blur(10px)', transform: 'translate3d(0, 2rem, 0)' },
          to: { opacity: '1', filter: 'blur(0)', transform: 'translate3d(0, 0, 0)' },
        },
        slideInUpSmall: {
          from: { opacity: '0', filter: 'blur(5px)', transform: 'translate3d(0, 5px, 0)' },
          to: { opacity: '1', filter: 'blur(0)', transform: 'translate3d(0, 0, 0)' },
        },
        marquee: {
          '0%': { transform: 'translateX(0)' },
          '100%': { transform: 'translateX(-50%)' },
        },
        'marquee-reverse': {
          '0%': { transform: 'translateX(-50%)' },
          '100%': { transform: 'translateX(0)' },
        },
        pulseGold: {
          '0%, 100%': { boxShadow: '0 0 0 0 rgba(201, 162, 39, 0.4)' },
          '50%': { boxShadow: '0 0 20px 10px rgba(201, 162, 39, 0)' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## B. Protex-Style Animation Classes Reference

From the Webflow template, these are the key animation patterns:

```css
/* Initial state (before animation) */
.animate-initial {
  opacity: 0;
  filter: blur(10px);
  transform: translate3d(0, 2rem, 0) scale3d(1, 1, 1) rotateX(0) rotateY(0) rotateZ(0) skew(0, 0);
}

/* Final state (after animation) */
.animate-final {
  opacity: 1;
  filter: blur(0);
  transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0) scale3d(1, 1, 1) rotateX(0) rotateY(0) rotateZ(0) skew(0, 0);
}

/* Marquee track structure */
.logo_list {
  display: flex;
  /* Content is duplicated for seamless loop */
}

/* Testimonial dual-row structure */
.testimonial_component {
  display: flex;
}

.testimonial_component.is-reversed {
  /* Reverses animation direction */
}

.testimonial_loop-trigger {
  /* Contains duplicated cards for seamless loop */
}
```
